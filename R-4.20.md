# R-4.20

Give a big-Oh characterization, in terms of _n_, of the running time of the `Ex5` function.

    Algorithm Ex5(A,B):
        Input: Arrays A and B each storing n ≥ 1 integers.
        Output: The number of elements in B equal to the sum of prefix sums in A.
    c ← 0
    for i ← 0 to n − 1 do
        s ← 0
        for j ← 0 to n − 1 do
            s ← s + A[0]
            for k ← 1 to j do
                s ← s + A[k]
        if B[i] = s then
            c ← c + 1
    return c
