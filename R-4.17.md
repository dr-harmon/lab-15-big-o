# R-4.17

Give a big-Oh characterization, in terms of _n_, of the running time of the `Ex2` function.

    Algorithm Ex2(A):
        Input: An array A storing n ≥ 1 integers.
        Output: The sum of the elements at even cells in A.
    s ← A[0]                                                      1
    for i ← 2 to n − 1 by increments of 2 do                      n/2
        s ← s + A[i]                                              1
        { increment i}                                            1
    return s                                                      1

f(n) = 1 + n/2 (1 + 1) + 1
     = 2n/2 + 2
     = n + 2
     = O(n)
