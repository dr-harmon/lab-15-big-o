# R-4.17

Give a big-Oh characterization, in terms of _n_, of the running time of the `Ex2` function shown in Code Fragment 4.6.

    Algorithm Ex2(A):
        Input: An array A storing n ≥ 1 integers.
        Output: The sum of the elements at even cells in A.
    s ← A[0]
    for i ← 2 to n − 1 by increments of 2 do
        s ← s + A[i]
    return s
