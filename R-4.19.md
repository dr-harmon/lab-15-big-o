# R-4.19

Give a big-Oh characterization, in terms of _n_, of the running time of the `Ex4` function.

    Algorithm Ex4(A):
        Input: An array A storing n ≥ 1 integers.
        Output: The sum of the prefix sums in A.
    s ← A[0]
    t ← s
    for i ← 1 to n − 1 do
        s ← s + A[i]
        t ← t + s
    return t
